love jones cleverly portrays young african-american men and women in a clear, positive, realistic sense. i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood. nia long and larenz tate worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them. as a matter of fact all of the actors/actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic-comedy from them. this movie can be compared to most any well-written, romantic comedy. if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.
this film is terrible - honestly. the acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which i usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. of course, before that it has the clich√© "you really believe that? ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. the witch's cannibal son was made a retard (i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both). it has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse. heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.<br /><br />honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.
this is a funny film and i like it a lot. cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee. this is, of course, the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham. the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part, but still works well. a comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much, it's well worth a rent!
this movie makes me want to fall in love all over again!i am naming my next daughter "adelaide". just so that someone who sings like ol blue eyes can swoon her one day, and feel the butterflies i felt hearing it sung, and it wasn't even to me! i give it a 9/10
all day now i've been watching dinosaurs, and all day they've had the same fundamental problem.<br /><br />they don't believe in firearms. they just don't seem to have been _told_ about them or something. bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then... aah, no. come on. if they're close enough to chemically operate today, they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles. it's that simple.<br /><br />look, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire. they're nothing magic. you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs. they don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special. small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them. somewhat (but not really) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run. (hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.)<br /><br />most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire. between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away. an exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds. cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded. we've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. a big cat will run if it can, but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation. where a t.rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. their behavior simply has not been observed. with these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. with a t.rex, of course, this could be a serious problem. i've seen a t.rex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! <br /><br />so here we have cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous mexican campaign, apparently) captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t.rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them. ok, maybe they don't have m-16s like the guys in the "carnosaur" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made from trees) and swords. maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they've several guys and i'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. oh, wait, there's a _cannon_, about a 4-incher. that's just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus' skull! so they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first t.rex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait. cortez points out that they'll not have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. t.rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! forget it. end of credibility. a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez' torso armor, and a 4" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! this would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4" cannon ball?) and here's t.rex, still standing, not even bleeding. so cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which (i guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it. yaaay, pointed sticks! <br /><br />the dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. this runs it off, so it's not as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the movies.<br /><br />they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. my money would still be on the cannon. it's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target. a bomb is a much more diffused application of force. a _real_ bomb (not a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. (think: pipe bomb vs firecracker.) a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof. (trust me on that one.)
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (hearts of darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.<br /><br />the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film's greatest asset. you actually feel like your in vietnam.<br /><br />all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall ("i love the smell of napalm in the morning!!") martin sheen, and the great marlon brando.<br /><br />a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky, weird and cerebral near the end. well, remeber what coppolla said about this movie, "this film is not about vietnam, it is vietnam!" what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war.<br /><br />this movie is based on the short story "heart of darkness" by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.<br /><br />this is perfect, challenging film that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.<br /><br />a true classic<br /><br />rating:10
like several other reviewers here, i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. dan o'bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'alien' of 1979. because it and 'star wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'used' or 'dirty space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.<br /><br />rather than dismiss 'lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of british horror and science-fiction - specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass (specifically 'quatermass and the pit', 1967), doctor who and 'the day of the triffids' (1963), if not the works of gerry anderson ('ufo', 'space:1999' and 'thunderbirds'). but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o'bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'queen of blood'(1966) and 'it! the terror from beyond space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'alien' (1979).<br /><br />granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'an american werewolf in london' and 'the company of wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.<br /><br />neil jordan's 'wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'american werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. it's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'scream' franchise, 'i know what you did last summer' and 'final destination'. but these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'lifeforce' belong a canon of british sci-fi - even if this one was written by an american.<br /><br />in many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('independence day', 'armageddon', 'deep impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. at the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade 'solaris'...<br /><br />the goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.<br /><br />7/10
film version of sandra bernhard's one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. but she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. she doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. but even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****
spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii, or goodfellas. it is not in the same league.<br /><br />but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.<br /><br />ah well, the script ain't too hot either. don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.
i think it was an overrated pg-13 crap! at least brittany snow's performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. the deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. the movie was very boring too and very overrated. it wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. its another bad pg-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie imo. the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. the movie is pretty slow too. overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.
this movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer's life and his last stand', do not rent `they died with their boots on'. but, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />the story starts out with custer's (errol flynn) first day at west point. everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles, including his battle in the civil war. the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn. in between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with libby (olivia de havilland).<br /><br />errol flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave george armstrong custer well. olivia de havilland plays the cute, sweet libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet. their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. the acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of callie played by hattie mcdaniel. her character will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. the script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. the director's portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero. others will watch this movie and learn hate him.<br /><br />i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.
i vaguely remember this film. i do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that i have ever walked out on!! and since then i have never seen it available to rent anywhere!! i can't spoil it for anyone cos i can barely remember it!! to think, looking at the cast, it seemed a winner, with john landis directing, but good god, they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel!! all i can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him, by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer. i walked out after about half an hour of this. i must confess though, i'd love to see if i can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad!!<br /><br />it wouldn't surprise me if this was on every actor's black list! i mean christopher lee was in this?? the legend of all bad guys, who'd been in star wars and lord of the rings?? as i said - black listed movie, the stupids!
one of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day british society. david morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. at first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. i have never seen surrane jones before. i believe she comes from the world of television soaps. her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. it is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse: in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock's psycho, i was very scared and deeply disturbed. i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way. but none where satisfactory. amongst those tried and failed were the birds, night of the living dead, the silence of the lambs, the blair witch project, ring, the evil dead, the sixth sense, 28 days later, the texas chainsaw massacre, halloween, near dark, alien, peeping tom, the cell, rosemary's baby, don't look now, witchfinder general, friday the 13th and the omen. that should confirm i was desperate! long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse ¬Ö¬Ö.<br /><br />paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own, called marianne dreams. paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films, but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film. i discovered the truth while on the internet, i bought the film later that day.<br /><br />i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull. unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not. it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same. one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and i mean genuinely unnerving). more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld, eg an apple tree. anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world. mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house, obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark can't walk. so anna decides to draw her father in. she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes. quote "he looks like madman". so anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out). then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br />paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street! the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset. but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years. the question is how dose the compare with psycho? answer, 1 the old dark house, 2 psychological parental fears, 3 a genuine shock, 4 and very scary music.
this harold lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts. of course, i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. that's what the bulk of this story is, harold and his wife, mildred davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (noah young) is burglarizing their house. half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another lloyd short, "haunted spooks."<br /><br />however, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which i probably wouldn't watch again. lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. it just isn't that funny.
we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and i absolutely loved this movie. i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch. the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone. i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed. this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. this is a movie i will show to my children. the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that. it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.
misty ayers had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was about. pure exploitation flick. i started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. case in point: casually walking into a room and saying "hello" was scored with chase music from a roman epic. i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. what i learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties. at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a "look out! godzirra!" effect.
i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when 6 or so years old in 1967?. i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then mowgli for the next year. i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again. when we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be? my dad then said 'i bet you wished to be an eagle' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away...
this movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with ed wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in "glen or glenda?"<br /><br />the subject: playing bridge. the park avenue set plays it; the bohemians play it. the russians -- who speak very questionable "russian" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak english -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />if one isn't interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />loretta young and paul lukas are fine. (well --frank mchugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as lukas is an unlikely russian.) but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.
yes, this film has many gay characters. it also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence. <br /><br />this is not a film about sexual orientation. it's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. filmically, denys arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships. the serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed). <br /><br />thomas gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. the supporting cast is strong, especially mia kirshner as gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /><br />the film's involving and often surprises in its character development. the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship", we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. arcand and the writer, brad fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.<br /><br />this film is a rewarding experience. it may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. loneliness is a universal experience. a film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.
